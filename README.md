# MinecraftBlacksmith

MinecraftBlacksmith is a mod loader for the Bedrock edition of Minecraft. Bedrock edition refers to Windows 10 Edition, Pocket Edition, and all other platforms that can cross-play with these platforms. It is currently just getting started, so only a few platforms are supported. We are currently in alpha edition, but it is alpha 0.0.0.0.1. We are still working on the game engine, so if you want to try MinecraftBlacksmith you must wait. MinecraftBlacksmith is based on Minecraft Forge. Our goal is to allow Forge mods to run on MinecraftBlacksmith.
