## Windows 10 Edition Source Code
If you would like to get a copy of the Windows 10 Edition source, you will need it installed. If you do not have a PC, you can get Windows 10 Enterprise Edition [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines), and run Windows 10 within a virtual machine. Minecraft Windows 10 edition comes with Java Edition, so if you have Java Edition, all you need to do to get the game is redeem the code found on your [Mojang account page](https://account.mojang.com/me).
